==================================================================
		AWS EKS (Elasti Service for Kubernetes)
==================================================================
	- Kubernetes on AWS before EKS
		- Kubernetes is taking IT by strom, with termendous adoption.
		- IT perfessional need to be able to create and operate K8s cluster.
		- Treditionally that meant deploy kubernetes yourself:
			- Deploy Master Nodes
			- Deploy Etcd
			- Setup CA for TCL encryption
			- Setup monitoring / auto scaling / self healing
			- Setup security such as authentication and authorization
			- Finally setup the worker nodes
		- After all this you'r finally done. (Just for setup)
	
	- Kubernetes with AWS EKS
		- Its handles all hard kubernetes setup for you.
			- Master nodes in HA (High Availability)
			- Etcd esembled in HA
			- API server
			- KubeDNS
			- Scheduler
			- Controller Manager
			- Cloud Controller
		- And you just need to deploy the Worker Nodes and Your application.
		- Finally authentication will be handled through IAM !
		
	- EKS Setup Process (under the hood)
		- EKS will setup and manage out Kubernetes masters.

		Create EKS	=> 	K8s Master	=> 	Etcd 	=> 	IAM Plugin	=> 	CA setup	=> 	Auto Scaling	=>	Load Balancer 
		Cluster			in HA			in HA		Setup			(for TLS)							(NLB & ELB)
		
	- Deep Integration with AWS
		- API calls can be audited in CloudTrail
		- Authentication is through IAM while authorization through RBAC
		- CloudFormation templates to manage your cluster
		- You can customize the AMI for your nodes.
		- Load Balancers, EBS Volumes, EFS, etc...
		- Container registries on ECR,
		- Network is handled with a per-pod IP address with attached ENI
		- CLI integration
		
		- But its still the Kubernetes Opensource Project!
	
	- Amazon EKS use cases
		- You can create as many clusters you want as per your need.
		- Microservices in conatainers
		- Platform as a Service / Website
		- Migrate on-permise cluster to cloud Kubernetes cluster
		- Machine Learning cluster (Support for GPU instances)
		- And rest is you imagination 
		
	- What We will Learn from This Course 
		- Deploy your EKS cluster using CloudFormation
		- Scale your Kubernetes cluster
		- Setup KubeCtl properly to access your cluster
		- Learn how EKS works under the hood and its integrations with AWS
		- Setup administration using the Kubernetes Dashboard
		- Deploy a stateless application on EKS and expose it with a public ELB
		- Deploy a stateful application on EKS and bind it with EBS volumes
		- Deploy a stateful application (such as wordpress) with EFS network drives
		- Manage your Kubernetes cluster using the AWS CLI and EksCtl CLI

		- Master node and Etcd is managed by EKS where as Worker Nodes are managed by user itself
		
	- EKS Pricing - Warning
		- Each EKS cluster cost $0.20 per hour
		- That's $144 per month
		- There is no free tier for EKS
		- On top of it, you will pay for worker nodes EC2 instances, EBS volumes, Load Balancers etc.
		
	- IAM User for EksCtl
		- IAM user need to be create with suficient permission, which can manage entire EKS cluster.
		- There are verious roles and policies need to be granted to this user. AdminstartorAccess, EKS, CloudFormation etc.
	
	- AWS EKS Cluster Setup
		- Prerequisites to grant access to IAM User
			-- Create IAM Role : K8s assumes this role to create AWS resources.
			-- Create SSH Key : To be able to SSH to you EC2 instances.
			-- Create Access Key+Secret : Enable authentication for API access.
			
		- Setup CommandLine CLI tools to your machine to interact with AWS, EKS and K8s Cluster. Install all below given tools.
			-- aws ctl : Required as dependency of eksctl to grab authentication token (Version 1.16.156 or greater). Prerequisites: Python & Python pip
			-- eksctl : setup and interact with EKS to manage EKS cluster and perform operatoins on them.
			-- kubectl : interaction with K8s API server.
		
		- Create EKS cluster via eksctl (https://eksctl.io)
			-- eksctl 
				--- eksctl is created by Weaveworks, then promoted to official AWS EKS cli (announcement summer 2019)
				--- creation & management of EKS cluster.
				--- create ymal file to provide a template to create EKS cluster using eksctl 
				--- take help of eksctl documentations (https://eksctl.io) for how to setup EKS cluster via eksctl.
				
			-- initial cluster inforamation
				--- region: us-east-1
				--- one nodegroup
				--- 3 worker nodes, type t2.small
				--- ssh access
