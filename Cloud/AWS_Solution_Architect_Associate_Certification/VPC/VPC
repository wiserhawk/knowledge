	VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

	VPC Overview
	===================================
	- What is VPC?
		- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud let you provision a logical isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you
		  define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environmnet, including selection of your own IP addresses range, creation of subnets, and
		  configuration of route tables and network gateways.
		- You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your
		  webservers that has access to	the internet, and place your backend systems such as database or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no
		  internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to EC2
		  instances in each subnet.
		- Additionally, you can create a Hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud
		  as an extension of your corporate datacenter.
		- VPC architecture with Public & Private Subnets, Security Groups, NACL, Route Table, Router and Internet Gateways are showed in image available in VPC directory
		  given below. Path : /knowledge/Cloud/AWS_Solution_Architect_Associate_Certification/VPC/VPC-with-Public-Private-Subnets-SG-NACL-RT-Router-IG.jpg
		
	- IP addresses for Private subnets:
		- Three ranges of IP addresses are reserved for Private Subnets:
			- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
			- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172/16/12 prefix)
			- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
	
	- What can we do with a VPC?
		- Launch instances into a subnet of your choice.
		- Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet.
		- Configure route table between subnets.
		- Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC.
		- Much better security control over your AWS resources.
		- Instance security groups
		- Subnet network access control lists (NACLs)
		
	- Default VPC vs Custom VPC
		- Default VPC is user friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy instances.
		- All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet.
		- Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address.
		
	- VPC Peering (VPC <------> VPC)
		- Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses.
		- Instances behave as if they were on the same private network.
		- You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPC's in the same account.
		- Peering is in a star configuration: i.e. 1 central VPC peers with 4 others. NO TRANSITIVE PEERING !!!
		- You can peer between regions.
		
	- No Transitive Peering (To talk between VPC-B & VPC-D, need direct peering between them, cannot talk through transitive peering via VPC-A)

	- Remember
		- 1 Subnet = 1 Availibility Zone
		- Security Groups are Stateful; NACL are Stateless.
		- Security Group cannot span VPCs.
		- No Transitive Peering
		- US-EAST-1A in your AWS account can be completely different AZ to US-EAST-1A in another AWS account. The AZ's are randomized.
		
	- What happens when you create just a VPC?
		- It create a default Router.
		- It create a default Route Table.
		- It create a default NACL.
		- It create a default Security Group.
		- It does NOT create any default Subnet.
		- It does NOT create any Internet Gateway.
	
	- Subnets
		- Subnets can not span across AZs.
		- Amazon reserve 5 IP address from Subnet for internal usages.
			- 10.0.0.0: Network address.
			- 10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
			- 10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. IP address of the DNS server is always the base of VPC network range plus two; however, AWS also reserve the base of each
						subnet range plus two. For VPCs with multiple CIDR blocks, the IP address of the DNS server is located in the primary CIDR.
			- 10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
			- 10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. AWS do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore it reserve this address.
	
	- Internet Gateways
		- By default Internet Gateway is detached once you create it. You have to manually attached it with VPC.
		- You can have only one Internet Gateway per VPC. AWS takes care of High Availibility of Internet Gateway.
		
	- Route Table
		- All subnet create by default connected to Main Route Table (Default), that means they are by default pulic. Which is kind of security concern.
		- For this we can make our Main Route Table as private and can create separate Route Table a public.
