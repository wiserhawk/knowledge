	VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
===================================================

	===================================
	VPC Overview
	===================================
	- What is VPC?
		- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud let you provision a logical isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you
		  define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environmnet, including selection of your own IP addresses range, creation of subnets, and
		  configuration of route tables and network gateways.
		- You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your
		  webservers that has access to	the internet, and place your backend systems such as database or application servers in a private-facing subnet with no
		  internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to EC2
		  instances in each subnet.
		- Additionally, you can create a Hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud
		  as an extension of your corporate datacenter.
		- VPC architecture with Public & Private Subnets, Security Groups, NACL, Route Table, Router and Internet Gateways are showed in image available in VPC directory
		  given below. Path : /knowledge/Cloud/AWS_Solution_Architect_Associate_Certification/VPC/VPC-with-Public-Private-Subnets-SG-NACL-RT-Router-IG.jpg
		
	- IP addresses for Private subnets:
		- Three ranges of IP addresses are reserved for Private Subnets:
			- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
			- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172/16/12 prefix)
			- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
	
	- What can we do with a VPC?
		- Launch instances into a subnet of your choice.
		- Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet.
		- Configure route table between subnets.
		- Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC.
		- Much better security control over your AWS resources.
		- Instance security groups
		- Subnet network access control lists (NACLs)
		
	- Default VPC vs Custom VPC
		- Default VPC is user friendly, allowing you to immediately deploy instances.
		- All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet.
		- Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address.
		
	- VPC Peering (VPC <------> VPC)
		- Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses.
		- Instances behave as if they were on the same private network.
		- You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPC's in the same account.
		- Peering is in a star configuration: i.e. 1 central VPC peers with 4 others. NO TRANSITIVE PEERING !!!
		- You can peer between regions.
		
	- No Transitive Peering (To talk between VPC-B & VPC-D, need direct peering between them, cannot talk through transitive peering via VPC-A)

	- Remember
		- 1 Subnet = 1 Availibility Zone
		- Security Groups are Stateful; NACL are Stateless.
		- Security Group cannot span VPCs.
		- No Transitive Peering
		- US-EAST-1A in your AWS account can be completely different AZ to US-EAST-1A in another AWS account. The AZ's are randomized.
		
	- What happens when you create just a VPC?
		- It create a default Router.
		- It create a default Route Table.
		- It create a default NACL.
		- It create a default Security Group.
		- It does NOT create any default Subnet.
		- It does NOT create any Internet Gateway.
	
	- Subnets
		- Subnets can not span across AZs.
		- Amazon reserve 5 IP address from Subnet for internal usages.
			- 10.0.0.0: Network address.
			- 10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
			- 10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. IP address of the DNS server is always the base of VPC network range plus two; however, AWS also reserve the base of each
						subnet range plus two. For VPCs with multiple CIDR blocks, the IP address of the DNS server is located in the primary CIDR.
			- 10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
			- 10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. AWS do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore it reserve this address.
	
	- Internet Gateways
		- By default Internet Gateway is detached once you create it. You have to manually attached it with VPC.
		- You can have only one Internet Gateway per VPC. AWS takes care of High Availibility of Internet Gateway.
		
	- Route Table
		- All subnet create by default connected to Main Route Table (Default), that means they are by default pulic. Which is kind of security concern.
		- For this we can make our Main Route Table as private and can create separate Route Table a public.
		
	===================================
	NAT Instances & NAT Gateways	
	===================================
	- What is Network Address Translation (NAT)?
		- Your EC2 instances in private subnets do not have direct access to internet. Therefore you cannot do all those activities on private EC2 instances which
		  are dependent on internet e.g. Softwares installation/update, security patch update etc. NAT Instances or NAT Gateways provides a indirect access of 
		  internet to private EC2 instances.
		  
	- NAT Instances:
		- NAT Instances are single EC2 instances on public subnets. You can search "NAT" to get NAT Amazon AMIs and lauch an EC2 instance in public subnet.
		
	- NAT Gateways:
		- NAT Gateways are highly available gateways to handle internet communications. 9 out of 10 time you will use NAT Gateways in your requirements. They spread
		  across multiple AZs. They don't dependes on single instance. 
		- If you have resources in multiple Availibility Zones and they share one NAT gateway, in the event of that the NAT gateway's Availibility Zone is down,
		  resources in other Availibility Zones lose internet access. To create an Availibility Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availibility
		  Zone and configure your routing to ensure the resources use the NAT gateway in the same availability Zone.
		 
	- NAT Instance Exam Tips:
		- When creating NAT instance, Disable Source/Destination Checks on the instance.
		- NAT instance must be in public subnet.
		- There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance, in order of this to work.
		- The amount of traffic that NAT instances can support dependes on the instance size. If you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size.
		- You can create high availability using Autoscaling Groups, multiple subnets in different AZs, and script to automate failover. But everthing need to be
		  handle by use only.
		- NAT instances are always behind a Security Group.
		
	- NAT Gateways Exam Tips:
		- Redundant inside the Availibility Zone. It can handle NAT failure automatically. 
		- Preferred by the enterprise.
		- Starts throughput at 5Gbps and scales currently to 45Gbps.
		- No need to patch
		- Not associated with security groups.
		- Automatically assigned a public IP address.
		- Remember to update your Route Tables.
		- No need to Disable Source/Destination Checks.
		
	===================================
	Network Access Control List (NACL)
	===================================
	- What is NACL?
		- A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more
		  subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.
		  
	- Network ACL Basics:
		- Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL. By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, 
		  IPv6 traffic.
		- You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic 
		  until you add rules.
		- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically 
		  associated with the default network ACL.
		- You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate 
		  a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.
		- A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules. We evaluate the rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic 
		  is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL. The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766. We recommend that you start 
		  by creating rules in increments (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new rules where you need to later on.
		- A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.
		- Network ACLs are stateless, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).
		- Block IP addresses using NACLs not Security Groups.
	
	===================================
	Security Groups
	===================================
	- What is Security Group?
		- A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign 
		  up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your 
		  VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.
		- If you launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool and you don't specify a security group, the instance is automatically assigned
   		  to the default security group for the VPC. If you launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 console, you have an option to create a new security group for 
		  the instance.
		- For each security group, you add rules that control the inbound traffic to instances, and a separate set of rules that control the outbound traffic. 
		  This section describes the basic things that you need to know about security groups for your VPC and their rules.
		- You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.
		  
	- Security Groups Basics:
		- There are quotas on the number of security groups that you can create per VPC, the number of rules that you can add to each security group, and the number 
		  of security groups that you can associate with a network interface.
		- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
		- You can specify separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
		- When you create a security group, it has no inbound rules. Therefore, no inbound traffic originating from another host to your instance is allowed until 
		  you add inbound rules to the security group.
		- By default, a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic. You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that allow specific 
		  outbound traffic only. If your security group has no outbound rules, no outbound traffic originating from your instance is allowed.
		- Security groups are stateful — if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of inbound
   		  security group rules. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.
		- NOTE — Some types of traffic are tracked differently from other types. For more information, see Connection tracking 
		  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html#security-group-connection-tracking) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for 
		  Linux Instances.
		- Instances associated with a security group can't talk to each other unless you add rules allowing the traffic (exception: the default security group has 
		  these rules by default).
		- Security groups are associated with network interfaces. After you launch an instance, you can change the security groups that are associated with the 
		  instance, which changes the security groups associated with the primary network interface (eth0). You can also specify or change the security groups 
		  associated with any other network interface. By default, when you create a network interface, it's associated with the default security group for the VPC, 
		  unless you specify a different security group. For more information about network interfaces, see Elastic network interfaces.
		- When you create a security group, you must provide it with a name and a description. The following rules apply:
			- Names and descriptions can be up to 255 characters in length.
			- Names and descriptions are limited to the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, spaces, and ._-:/()#,@[]+=&;{}!$*.
			- A security group name cannot start with sg- as these indicate a default security group.
			- A security group name must be unique within the VPC.
		- A security group can only be used in the VPC that you specify when you create the security group.
		
	===================================
	Custom VPC & ELBsn
	===================================
	- Important of Exam
		- You can create a public facing ELB on your VPC. But there are two Important thing you need to remember.
			- All your subnets must be connected with Internet Gateways to setup load balancer on them. i.e your subnets must be public.
			- To setup Elastic load balancing, aleast two public subnets must be specifed. This is because of High Availibility architecture. 
			
	===================================
	VPC Flow Logs
	===================================
	- What are VPC Flow Logs?
		- VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
		  Flow log data is stored using Amazon CloudWatch Logs. After you have created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
	
	- VCP Flow Logs Levels (3 Levels)
		- VPC
		- Subnet
		- Network Interface Level
	
	- Flow Logs Exam Tips
		- You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your Account.
		- You can tag flow logs.
		- After you have created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration; for example, you can't associate a different IAM role with the flow log.
		- Not all IP traffic is monitored: 
			- Traffic generated by instances when they contact the Amazon DNS server. If you can use your own DNS server, then all traffic to that DNS server is     
			  logged.
		    - Traffic generated by a Windows instance for Amazon Windows license activation. 
		    - Traffic to and from 169.254.169.258 for instance metadata. (169.254.169.258 has done in EC2 section; 169.254.169.254 is used in Amazon EC2 and other
			  cloud computing platforms to distribute metadata to cloud instances. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)
			- DHCP traffic.
			- Traffic to the reserved IP address for the default VPC router.
	
	===================================
	Bastion Hosts
	===================================
	 - What is a Bastion Host?
		- A bastion host is a special purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. The
		  computer generally hosts a single application, e.g. a proxy server, and all other services are removed or limited to reduce
		  the threat to the computer. It is hardended in this manner primarily due to its location and purpose, which is either on the
		  outside of a firewall or in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and usually involved access from untrusted networks or computers.
	
	- Bastion Host Exam Tips:
		- A NAT Gateway or NAT Instance is used to provide internet access to EC2 instances in a private subnets.
		- A Bastion is used to securely administer EC2 instances (Using SSH or RDP). Bastions are called Jump Boxes in Australia.
		- You cannot use a NAT Gateway as a Bastion host. If you want to SSH or RDP your private EC2 instances directly; you have to
		  use Bastion Host, you cannot do it through NAT Gateway. 
	
	===================================
	Direct Connect [SAA-C02]
	===================================
	- What is AWS Direct Connect?
		- Direct Connect is a network service that allows a customer to establish a dedicated network connection between one of Amazon's Direct Connect 
		  locations and the customer's data center or colocation environment.
		- Direct Connect provides Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers with a way to transfer data that does not involve using the public Internet. According 
		  to Amazon, private network connections provide a safer, more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. Direct Connect is also 
		  useful for customers whose corporate governance prohibits the use of the public Internet for transferring sensitive data because of compliance concerns.
		- Direct Connect can be used with all AWS services, including EC2, VPC, S3, and DynamoDB. AWS charges for data transferred over the dedicated connection 
		  at a reduced rate rather than the standard Internet data transfer rate (DTR), and pricing is per port-hour.
	
	-  Setting Up Direct Connect - Steps
		- Create a virtual interface in the Direct Connect console. This is a PUBLIC Virtual Interface.
		- Go to the VPC console and the to VPN connections. Create a Customer Gateway.
		- Create a Virtual Private Gateway.
		- Attach the Virtual Private Gateway to the desired VPC.
		- Select VPN Connections and create new VPN connection.
		- Select the Virtual Private Gateway and the Customer Gateway.
		- Once the VPN is available, set up the VPN on the customer gateway or firewall.
		
	- Exam Tips:
		- Remember all above steps, memorize them for exam.

	Global Accelerator [SAA-C02]
	===================================
	- What is AWS Global Accelerator?
		- AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve availability and performance of your applicables for local and global users. 
		- Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network. This improves the availability and performance of your internet applicables
		  that are used by a global audience.
		- By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. Aternatively, you can bring your own.
	
	- Global Accelerator includes the following components:
		- Static IP addresses
		- Accelerator
		- DNS Names
		- Network Zone
		- Listener
		- Endpoint Group
		- Endpoint
		
	- Static IP Addresses:
		- By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. or you can bring your own.
		- For example: 1.2.3.4 and 5.6.7.8
		
	- Accelerator:
		- An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network. This improves the availability and performance of your internet applicables
		  that are used by a global audience. 
		- Each accelerator includes one or more listeners.
		
	- DNS Name:
		- Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default DNS name - similar to a123456789abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com - that points to the static IP addresses that
		  global accelerator assigns to you.
		- Depending on the use case, you can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your accelerator, or setup DNS records to route traffic
		  using your own custom domain name.
		  
	- Network Zone:
		- A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availibility Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with
		  its own set of physical infrastructure.
		- When you configure an accelerator, by default Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP
		  address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.
	
	- Listener:
		- A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the port (or port range) and protocol that you configure. Global Accelerator supports
		  both TCP and UDP protocols.
		- Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups.
		- You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. Traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints with in the 
		  endpoint groups associated with a listener. 

	- Endpoint Group:
		- Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region.
		- Endpoint groups include one or more endpoints in the Region.
		- You can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial.
		- The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing for new releases across different AWS Regions, for example.
	
	- Endpoint:
		- Endpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses.
		- An Application Load Balancer endpoint can be an internet-facing or internal. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint
		  weights.
		- For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example,
		  to do performance testing within a Region.
