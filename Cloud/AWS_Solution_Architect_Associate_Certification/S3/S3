	S3 (SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE)
=======================================

	===========================
	What is S3?
	===========================
	- S3 provides developers an IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.
	- Amazon S3 is easy to use, with simple web serevice interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
	- S3 is safe place to store your files.
	- It is object based storage. i.e allows you to upload files.
	- Data is shared across multiple devices and facilities.
	- File can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
	- The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. For objects larger than 100 MB, 
	  customers should consider using the Multipart Upload capability. The multipart upload API is designed to improve 
	  the upload experience for larger objects. You can upload objects in parts. These object parts can be uploaded independently, 
	  in any order, and in parallel. You can use a multipart upload for objects from 5 MB to 5 TB in size. 
	- There is unlimited storage.
	- Files are stored in Buckets. Bucket is just a directory to store files.
	- S3 is a universal namespace. That means bucket names must be unique globally. for example,
		Global: https://uniquebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/
		Regional: https://uniquebucket.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
	- When you upload a file to S3 bucket, you will receive a HTTP 200 status code if the file upload was successful.
	
	============================
	S3 Objects
	============================
	- S3 is object based. Think of Objects just as files.
	- Objects consist of the following:
		- Key (This is simply the name of the object)
		- Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
		- VersionID (Important of versioning, S3 allows mutiple versions of a file)
		- Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
		- Subresources:
			- Access Control Lists: Amazon S3 access control lists (ACLs) enable you to manage access to buckets and objects. 
			  Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a subresource. It defines which AWS accounts or groups are 
			  granted access and the type of access. When a request is received against a resource, Amazon S3 checks the 
			  corresponding ACL to verify that the requester has the necessary access permissions.
			- Torrent: The torrent subresource to return torrent files from a bucket. BitTorrent can save you bandwidth when 
			  you're distributing large files
	
	============================
	S3 Obejcts Consistency
	============================
	- Read After Write consistency for PUTS of new objects. It means if you upload a new file to S3 you can read its data immediately.
	- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate). 
	  That means if you update file (overwrite with new version) or delete file and try to read it immediately 
	  in that case you may read older version or may not. Basically changes to objects can take a little bit of time to propagate.	
	  
	============================
	S3 Guarantees
	============================
	- Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform.
	- Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability.
	- Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability for S3 data (Remember 11x9s).
	
	============================
	S3 Features
	============================
	- Tiered Storage Available: Multiple tier types are available to stored data based on it usages and costs.
	- Lifecycle Management: Data can be move from one bucket to another bucket or one tier to another tier as a data lifecycle.
	- Versioning: Single data file can have multiple versions of it by enabling versioning on bucket.
	- Encryption: You can encrypt your data files at rest using multiple encryption types.
	- MFA Delete: You can enable Multy Factor Authentication to delete objects.
	- Secure data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies.
	
	======================================================================
	S3 Storage Classes (Tiers) https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/
	======================================================================
	- S3 STANDARD: 99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, 
	  and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
	- S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed): For the data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. 
	  Lower fee than S3 Standard, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
	- S3 ONE ZONE-IA: For where you want lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, 
	  but don't require the multiple Availability Zone data resiliency.
	- S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING: Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, 
	  without performance impact or operational overhead. It use machine learning to identify how often you use particular data 
	  and move them to its suitable S3 tier.
	- S3 GLACIER: S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. 
	  You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper then on-permises solutions. 
	  Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.
	- S3 GLACIER DEEP ARCHIVE: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is  mazon S3's lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

	============================
	S3 Charges
	============================
	- You are charged for S3 in the following ways:
		- STORAGE: Based on size of data stored.
		- REQUESTES: Based on how many I/O requests gone to S3 bucket.
		- STORAGE MANAGEMENT CHARGES: Data management charges for managing data on S3 for long times.
		- DATA TRANSFER CHARGES: Based on amount of data transfered in or out over S3.
		- TRANSFER ACCELERATION: Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances 
		  between your end users and a S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's (CDN) globally distributed 
		  edge locations, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.
		- CROSS REGION REPLICATION CHARGES: You can replicate data over different region buckets for high availability and disaster management.
		  you can turn on cross region replicate for auto replication.

	- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
	- There is unlimited storage.
	- Files are stored in buckets.
	- S3 is a universal namespace. That is, name must be unique globally.
	- A unique DNS name get created for bucket.
	- It is only for files storage, Not suitable to install an operating systems / databases on.
	- Successful upload will generate a HTTP 200 status code.
	- You can turn on MFA on delete object. To protect from accidental delete.
	- Objects consist of the following:

	=============================================
	S3 Security & Encryption
	=============================================
	- By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE. You can setup access control to your buckets using:
		- Bucket Policies: it works on bucket level.
		- Access Control Lists: it works on individual object level.
	- S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket.
	  This can be sent to another bucket and even anoher bucket in another account.
	- Encryption In Transit (over https) is achieved by:
		- SSL/TLS
	- Encryption At Rest(Server Side) is achieved by:
		- S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 (Keys from AWS S3)
		- AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS (Keys from AWS S3 & Keys from Customer)
		- Server Side Encryption With Customer Provided Keys SSE-C (Keys from Customer)
	- Client Side Encryption 
		- client can encrypt object at their level and then upload it to S3 buckets.
		
	===============================================
	S3 Versioning 
	===============================================
	- Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
	- Greate backup tool.
	- Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.
	- Integrates with Lifecycle rules.
	- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security.
	- Newly ploaded version of a file don't inharit permission from older version. you have to provide permission explicitly.
	
	===============================================
	S3 Lifecycle Management
	===============================================
	- Automates moving your objects between the different storage tiers.
	- Can be used in conjunction with versioning.
	- Can apply to current versions and previous versions. 
	
	===================================================
	AWS Organizations Service & Consolidated Billing
	===================================================
	- What is AWS Organizations?
		- AWS Organizations is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts 
		  into an organization that you create and centrally manage.
		- Billing of different AWS accounts can be consolidate together as an Organization level. Basic idea behind this
		  is that in AWS "more you use, less you pay". So if you group entire aws accounts under one organization. 
		  You can save more by consolidating entire usages of accounts.
	- Advantages of Consolidated Billing
		- One bill per AWS account.
		- Very easy to track charges and allocate costs.
		- Volume pricing discounts.
	- Some Best Practices with AWS Organizations
		- Always enable multi-factor authentication on root account.
		- Always use a strong and complex password for root account.
		- Paying account should be used for billing purposes only. Don't deploy resources into the paying account.
		- Enable/Disable AWS services using Service Control Policies (SCP) either on OU (Operational Units) or on individual accounts.
		
	=============================================
	Sharing S3 Buckets Across Accounts
	=============================================
	- 3 different ways to share S3 buckets across accounts
		- Using Bucket Policies & IAM (Applies across the entire bucket). Programmatic Access Only.
		- Using Bucket ACL & IAM (Individual Objects). Programmatic Access Only.
		- Cross-account IAM Roles. Programmatic AND Console access.
	=============================================
	Cross Region Replication of S3 Buckets
	=============================================
	- You can replicate S3 buckets across regions. To create rule for cross region replication, versioning MUST be enabled on bucket.
	- While creating replication rule:
		- You can select to apply rule on entire bucket or objects using Prefix or Tags.
		- You can select destination bucket either by "Bucket in same Account" or "Bucket in another Account".
		- You need to select/create an IAM role. Provide access to S3 application on distination bucket.
	- Replication DO NOT work for already existing objects on source bucket. 
	  All newly uploaded objects on source bucket will get replicated on destination bucket.
	- Once a file get replicated among buckets. DELETE operation DO NOT get replicate across buckets.
	  This is done by AWS deliberately to protect objects from accidental deletes. If you want to delete objects,
	  you have to delete them manually.
	- Delete individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.
	
	=============================================
	S3 Transfer Acceleration
	=============================================
	- What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?
		- S3 Transfer Acceleration utilises the CloudFront Edge Location Network to accelerate your uploads to S3.
		  Instead of uploading files directly to your S3 bucket, you can user distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location
		  which will then transfer that file to S3. You will get a distinct URL to upload to. e.g. https://thebucket.s3.accelerate.amazonaws.com
	
	=============================================
	CloudFront Overview
	=============================================
	- What is CloudFront?
		- CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for AWS. CDN is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages
		  and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.
		  CloudFront can be used to deliver you entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming and interactive content using global network
		  of Edge Locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest Edge Location, so content is delivered with best
		  possible performance.
	- CloudFront Key Terminology
		- Edge Location: This is the server location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ.
		- Origin: This the origin of all files that the CDN will distribute. This can be a S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, 
		  an Elastic Load Balancer or Route53.
		- Distribution: This is the name given to CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations.
	- Types of Distribution using CloudFront
		- Web Distribution - Typically used for websites.
		- RTMP - Used for Media Streaming.
	- Remember
		- Edge Locations are NOT just READ only. You can write to them too. i.e. put an object on to them.
		- Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time to Live).
		- You can clean cached objects, but you will be charged for this.
