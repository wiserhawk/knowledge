	S3 (SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE)
=======================================

	===========================
	What is S3?
	===========================
	- S3 provides developers an IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage.
	- Amazon S3 is easy to use, with simple web serevice interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
	- S3 is safe place to store your files.
	- It is object based storage. i.e allows you to upload files.
	- Data is shared across multiple devices and facilities.
	- File cab be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
	- There is unlimited storage.
	- Files are stored in Buckets. Bucket is just a directory to store files.
	- S3 is a universal namespace. That means bucket names must be unique globally. for example,
		Global: https://uniquebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/
		Regional: https://uniquebucket.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
	- When you upload a file to S3 bucket, you will receive a HTTP 200 status code if the file upload was successful.
	
	============================
	S3 Objects
	============================
	- S3 is object based. Think of Objects just as files.
	- Objects consist of the following:
		- Key (This is simply the name of the object)
		- Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
		- VersionID (Important of versioning, S3 allows mutiple versions of a file)
		- Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
		- Subresources:
			- Access Control Lists
			- Torrent
	
	============================
	S3 Obejcts Consistency
	============================
	- Read After Write consistency for PUTS of new objects. It means if you upload a new file to S3 you can read its data immediately.
	- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate). 
	  That means if you update file (overwrite with new version) or delete file and try to read it immediately 
	  in that case you may read older version or may not. Basically changes to objects can take a little bit of time to propagate.	
	  
	============================
	S3 Guarantees
	============================
	- Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform.
	- Amazon Guarantee 99.9% availability.
	- Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability for S3 data (Remember 11x9s).
	
	============================
	S3 Features
	============================
	- Tiered Storage Available: Multiple tier types are available to stored data based on it usages and costs.
	- Lifecycle Management: Data can be move from one bucket to another bucket or one tier to another tier as a data lifecycle.
	- Versioning: Single data file can have multiple versions of it by enabling versioning on bucket.
	- Encryption: You can encrypt your data files at rest using multiple encryption types.
	- MFA Delete: You can enable Multy Factor Authentication to delete objects.
	- Secure data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies.
	
	======================================================================
	S3 Storage Classes (Tiers) https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/
	======================================================================
	- S3 STANDARD: 99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, 
	  and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
	- S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed): For the data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. 
	  Lower fee than S3 Standard, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
	- S3 ONE ZONE-IA: For where you want lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, 
	  but don't require the multiple Availability Zone data resiliency.
	- S3 INTELLIGENT-TIERING: Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, 
	  without performance impact or operational overhead. It use machine learning to identify how often you use particular data 
	  and move them to its suitable S3 tier.
	- S3 GLACIER: S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. 
	  You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper then on-permises solutions. 
	  Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.
	- S3 GLACIER DEEP ARCHIVE: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is  mazon S3's lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

	S3 Charges
	============================
	- You are charged for S3 in the following ways:
		- STORAGE: Based on size of data stored.
		- REQUESTES: Based on how many I/O requests gone to S3 bucket.
		- STORAGE MANAGEMENT CHARGES: Data management charges for managing data on S3 for long times.
		- DATA TRANSFER CHARGES: Based on amount of data transfered in or out over S3.
		- TRANSFER ACCELERATION: Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances 
		  between your end users and a S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's (CDN) globally distributed 
		  edge locations, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.
		- CROSS REGION REPLICATION CHARGES: You can replicate data over differnt region buckets for high availability and disaster management.
		  you can turn on cross region replicate for auto replication.

	Exam Tips
	============================
	- READ THE S3 FAQs BEFORE TAKING THE EXAM. IT COMES UP A LOT!!!!!!!!	
	- Remember that S3 is Obejct-based. i.e. allow you to to upload files.
	- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
	- There is unlimited storage.
	- Files are stored in buckets.
	- S3 is a universal namespace. That is, name must be unique globally.
	- A unique DNS name get created for bucket.
	- It is only for files storage, Not suitable to install an operating systems / databases on.
	- Successful upload will generate a HTTP 200 status code.
	- You can turn on MFA on delete object. To protect from accidental delete.
	- Objects consist of the following:
		- Key (This is simply the name of the object)
		- Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
