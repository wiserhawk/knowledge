	DNS (Domain Name Server)
	===================================
	- What is DNS?
		- DNS is used to convert human friendly name (such as http://google.com) into an Internet Protocol (IP) address (such as http://82.124.53.2).
		- IP addresses are used by computers to identify each other on the network. IP addresses commonly come in 2 different forms, IPv4 and IPv6.

	- IPv4 vs IPv6
		- IPv4 addresses are running out.
		- IPv4 space is a 32 bit field and have over 4 billion different addresses (4,294,967,296 to be precise).
		- IPv6 was create to solve this depletion issue and has a address sapce of 128 bits, which in theory is 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456
		  addresses or 340 undecillion addresses.
	
	- Top Level Domains
		- If we look at common domain names such as google.com, amazon.com, bbc.co.uk etc. You will notice a string of characters separated by dots. The last work
		  in a domain name represent the "Top Level Domain" e.g. google.com. Second work in a domain name is known as a Second Level Domain name (This is optional though and depend on
		  domain name like bbc.co.uk, where uk is top level and co is second level domain)
		- These Top Level Domain names are controlled by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) in a root zone database which is essentially a database of all
		  availble top level domains. You can view this database by visiting: http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db
		  
	- Domain Registration
		- Because all of the names in a given domain name have to be unique there need to be a way to organize this all so that domain names are not duplicated. This is
		  where domain registrars comes in. A registrar is an authority that can assign domain name directly under one or more top-level domains. These domains are 
		  registered  with InterNIC, a service of ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of domain names across the internet. Each domain name becomes registered in a central
		  database known as WhoIS database.
		  Popular damain registrars include: Amazon, GoDaddy.com, 123-reg.co.uk etc.
		  
	- Start Of Authority Record (SOA)
		- The SOA record stores information about:
			- The name of the server that supplies the data for the zone.
			- The administrator of the zone.
			- The current version of the data file.
			- The default number of seconds for the time-to-live file on resource records.
			
	- NS (Name Server) Records
		- They are used by Top Level Domain servers to direct traffic to the Content DNS server which contains the authoritative DNS records.
		- For Example:
			getfiteat.com -> .com (Top Level Domain) -> NS Records -> SOA
	
	- A Records
		- An "A" Record is the fundamental type of DNS record. The "A" is A record stands for "Address". The A record is used by computer to translate the name of
		  the domain to an IP address. For exmaple, http://google.com to http://123.10.10.80
		  
	- TTL
		- The length that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving Server or the users own local PC is equal to the value of the "Time To Live" (TTL) in seconds.
		  The lower the time to live, the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet.
		  
	- CNAME
		- A Canonical Name (CNAME) can be used to resolve one domain name to another. For exmaple, you may have mobile website with the domain name http://m.getfiteat.com 
		  that is used for when users browse to your domain name on their mobile device. You may also want to name http://mobile.getfiteat.com to resolve to this same address.
		
	- Alias Records
		- Alias records are used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront distributions, or S3 buckets that are configured
		  as websites.
		- Alias records work like a CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name (www.example.com) to another target DNS name (elb1234.elb.amazonaws.com).
		- Key difference - A CNAME cann't be used for naked domain names (zone apex record). You cann't have a CNAME for http://getfiteat.com, it must be either an
		  A Record or an Alias.
		  
	- Route53 Exam Tips:
		- ELBs do not have pre-defined IPv4 addresses; you can resolve them using a DNS name.
		- Understand difference between Alias Record and CNAME.
		- Given choise, always choose an Alias Record over an CNAME.
		- Common DNS Types:
			- SOA Records
			- NS Records
			- A Records
			- CNAME
			- MX Records (Used for mail)
			- PTR Records (Reverse of A Record; to look DNS name against an IP address)
		- You can buy domain name directly from AWS. It can take upto 3 days to register depending on circumstances.

	Route53 Routing Polices
	===================================
	- Routing Polices availble with Route53:
		- Simple Routing
		- Weighted Routing
		- Latency-based Routing
		- Failover Routing
		- Geolocation Routing
		- Geoproximity Routing (Traffic Flow Only)
		- Multivalue Answer Routing
		
	===================================
	Route53 Simple Routing Policy
	===================================
	- If you choose the simple routing policy you can only have one A Record with multiple IP addresses. If you specify multiple values (IPs) in A Record,
	  Route53 returns all values to the user in a random order.
	  
	===================================
	Route53 Weighted Routing Policy
	===================================
	- Allows you to split your traffic based on different weights assigned. For example, You can set 10% of your traffic to go to US-EAST-1 and 90% to EU-WEST-1.
	
	- Health Checks:
		- You can set health checks on individual record sets.
		- If a record set fails a health check, it will be removed from Route53 until it passes the health check. 
		- You can set SNS notifications to alert you if a health check is failed.
	
	======================================
	Route53 Latency-based Routing Policy
	======================================
	- Allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user (i.e. which region will give them the fastest response time).
	- To use latency-based routing, you create a latency resource record set for the Amazon EC2 (or ELB) resource in each region that host your website.
	  When Route53 receives a query for your site, it selects the latency resource record set for the region that gives the user the lowest latency. Route53
	  then responds with the value associated with  that resource record set.
	  
	===================================
	Route53 Failover Routing Policy
	===================================
	- Failover routing policies are used when you want to create an active/passive setup. For example, you may want your primary site to be in EU-WEST-1 and your
	  secondary DR site in AP-SOUTHEAST-2.
	- Route53 will monitor the health of your parimary site using a health check. A health check monitors the health of your end-points.
	
	===================================
	Route53 Geolocation Routing Policy
	===================================
	- Geolocation routing lets you choose where your traffic will be sent based on the geographic location of your users (i.e. the location from which DNS 
	  queries originate). For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to a fleet of EC2 instances that are specifically configured for
	  your European customers. These servers may have the local language of your European customers and all prices are displayed in Euros.
	  
	===================================
	Route53 Geoproximity Routing Policy
	===================================
	- Geoproximity routing (Traffic Flow Only) lets Route53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources.
	  You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A bias expends or shrinks the size 
	  of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.
	- To use Geoproximity routing, you must use Route53 Traffic Flow.
	- Geoproximity Routing is out of Scope from Solution Architect Associate & Professional Exam.
	
	===================================
	Route53 Multivalue Answer Policy
	===================================
	- Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Route53 to return multiple values, such as IPs for your web servers, in response to DNS queries. You can specify
	  multiple values for almost any record, but multivalue answer routing also lets you check the health of each resource, so Route53 returns only values for
	  healthy resources.
	- This is similar to simple routing however it allows you to put health checks on each record set.
