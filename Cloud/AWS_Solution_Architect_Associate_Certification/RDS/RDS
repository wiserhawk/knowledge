	RDS (Relational Database Service)
=========================================

	===================================
	Databases on AWS
	===================================
	- RDS (OLTP) Relational Databases on AWS
		- MS SQL Server
		- Oracle
		- MySQL
		- Aurora
		- PostgreSQL
		- Maria DB
	
	- RDS has two key features:
		- Multi-AZ: For Disaster Recovery
		- Read Replicas: For Performance
		
	- RDS Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases on AWS
		- DynamoDB
		
	- RDS (OLAP) Data Warehousing on AWS
		- Redshift
		
	- What is Data Warehousing?
		- Used for business intelligence . Tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server Reporting Services, Oracle Hyperion, SAP NetWeaver.
		- Used to pull in very large and complex data sets. Usually used by management to do queries on data (such as performance vs target etc).
		
		- OLTP vs OLAP
			- Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) differs from Online Analytics Processing (OLAP) in terms of types of queries you will run.
			- OLTP Example:
				- Order number 21234322
				- Pull up a row of data such as Name, Date, Address to deliver to, Delivery Status etc.
			- OLAP Example: Much complex
				- Net Profit for EMEA and Pacific for the Digital Radio Product.
				- Pull in large number of records.
				- Sum of Radios Sold in EMEA.
				- Sum of Radios Sold in Pacific.
				- Unit Cost of Radio in each region
				- Sale price of each radio
				- Sale Price - Unit Cost
		
		- Data Warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database perspective and infrastructure layer.
		- Amazon's Data Warehouse Solution is called Redshift
	
	- What is ElastiCache?
		- ElastiCache is a web service that make it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of
		  web applicaitons by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed , in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.
		- ElastiCache supports two fully managed open-source in-memory caching engines:
			- Redis
			- Memcached
			
	===================================
	RDS Instance
	===================================
	- RDS runs on Virtual Machines.
	- We can SSH to RDS Virtual Machines. These are internally AWS managed VM.
	- Patching of RDS OS and DB is Amazon's responsibility.
	- RDS is NOT Serverless.
	- There is option Aurora Serverless that is an exception case.
	
	==========================================
	RDS - Backups, Multi-AZ & Read Replicas
	==========================================
	- Backups : There are two different types of Backups for RDS.
		- Automated Backups
		- Database Snapshots
	
	- Automated Backups:
		- Automated Backups allow you to recover your database to any point in time within a "retention period". The retention period can be between one and 35 days.
		  Automated Backups will take a full daily snapshot and will also store transaction logs throughout the day. When you do a recovery, AWS will first choose
		  the most recent daily backup, and then apply transaction logs relevant to that day. This allows you to do a point in time recovery down to a second,
		  within the retention period.
		- Automated Backups are enabled by default. The backup data is stored in S3 and you get free storage space equal to the size of your database. So if you 
		  have an RDS instance of 10 GB, you will get 10 GB worth of storage.
		- Backups are taken within a defined window. During the backup window, storage I/O may be suspendended while your data is being backed up and you may 
		  experience elevated latency.
		  
	- Database Snapshots:
		- DB Snapshots are done manually (i.e they are user initialed.) They are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance, unlike automated backups.
		
	- Restoring Backups:
		- Whenever you restore either an Automatic Backup or a manual DB Snapshot, the restored version of database will be a entirely new RDS instance with 
		  a new DNS endpoint. e.g.
		  original.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com		=====>>>	restored.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
		  
	- Encryption At Restoring
		- Encryption at rest is supported for MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB & Aurora. Encryption is done using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
		  Once your RDS instance is encrypted, the data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas & snapshots.
		
	- What is Multi-AZ?
		- Multi-AZ allows you to have an exact copy of your production database in another Availability Zone. AWS handles the replication for you, so when your 
		  production is written to, this write will automatically be synchronized to the stand by database.
		- In the event to planned database maintenance, DB instance failure, or an Availability Zone failure, AWS RDS will automatically failover to the standby 
		  so that database operations can resume quickly without administrative intervaention.
		- Multi-AZ is available for the following databases:
			- SQL Server
			- Oracle
			- MySQL
			- PostgreSQL
			- MariaDB
		- Aurora by its architecture already a fault tolerant
		
	- What is Read Replicas?
		- Read replicas allow your to have a read-only copy of your production database. This is achieved by using Asynchronous replication from the primary RDS
		  instance to the read replicas. You use read replicas primarily for very read-heavy database workloads.
		- Read Replicas can be create from another read replica.
		- Read Replicas are available for the following databases:
			- MySQL
			- PostgreSQL
			- MariaDB
			- Oracle
			- Aurora
		- Things to know about Read Replicas:
			- Used for scaling, not for DR
			- Must have automatic backups turned-on on your primary database (source DB) in order to deploy a read replica.
			- You can have upto 5 read replica copies of an database.
			- You can have read replicas of read replicas (But watch out for latency)
			- Each read replica has its own DNS endpoints
			- You can now have read replicas that have Multi-AZ.
			- You can create read replicas of Multi-AZ source databases.
			- Read replicas can be promoted to master (be their own databases). This breaks the replication.
			- You can have a read replica in a second region.
