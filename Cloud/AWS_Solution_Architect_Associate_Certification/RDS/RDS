	Databases on AWS
	===================================
	- RDS (OLTP) Relational Databases on AWS
		- MS SQL Server
		- Oracle
		- MySQL
		- Aurora
		- PostgreSQL
		- Maria DB
	
	- RDS has two key features:
		- Multi-AZ: For Disaster Recovery
		- Read Replicas: For Performance
		
	- RDS Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases on AWS
		- DynamoDB
		
	- RDS (OLAP) Data Warehousing on AWS
		- Redshift
		
	- What is Data Warehousing?
		- Used for business intelligence . Tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server Reporting Services, Oracle Hyperion, SAP NetWeaver.
		- Used to pull in very large and complex data sets. Usually used by management to do queries on data (such as performance vs target etc).
		
		- OLTP vs OLAP
			- Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) differs from Online Analytics Processing (OLAP) in terms of types of queries you will run.
			- OLTP Example:
				- Order number 21234322
				- Pull up a row of data such as Name, Date, Address to deliver to, Delivery Status etc.
			- OLAP Example: Much complex
				- Net Profit for EMEA and Pacific for the Digital Radio Product.
				- Pull in large number of records.
				- Sum of Radios Sold in EMEA.
				- Sum of Radios Sold in Pacific.
				- Unit Cost of Radio in each region
				- Sale price of each radio
				- Sale Price - Unit Cost
		
		- Data Warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database perspective and infrastructure layer.
		- Amazon's Data Warehouse Solution is called Redshift
	
	- What is ElastiCache?
		- ElastiCache is a web service that make it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of
		  web applicaitons by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed , in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.
		- ElastiCache supports two fully managed open-source in-memory caching engines:
			- Redis
			- Memcached
