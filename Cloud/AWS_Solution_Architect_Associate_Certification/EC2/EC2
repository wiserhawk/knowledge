	EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
======================================

	=========================
	What is EC2?
	=========================
	- Amazon EC2 is web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and
	  boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up & down, as your computing requirement changes.
	
	=========================
	EC2 Pricing Models
	=========================
	- On Demand
		- Allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
		- Users that want to low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
		- Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
		- Applications being developed or tested on EC2 for first time.
	- Reserved
		- Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charges for a instance. 
		  Contract Terms are 1 year or 3 years Terms.
		- Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
		- Applications that required reserved capacity.
		- Users able to make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further.
		- Reserved Pricing Types
			- Standard Reserved Instances
				- These offer upto 75% off on demand instances. The more you pay up-front and the longer the contract, the greater the discount.
			- Convertible Reserved Instances
				- These offer upto 54% off on demand capability to change the attributes of the Reserved Instances as long as the exchanges 
				  results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value.
			- Scheduled Reserved Instances
				- These are available to launch within the time windows you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation
				  to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month.
	- Spot
		- Enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings.
		- Applications that have flexible start & end times.
		- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
		- Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.
		- If the Spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage.
		  However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.
	- Dedicated Hosts
		- Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your
		  existing server-bound software licenses. If you have strict licensing condition for example Oracle etc. 
		- Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
		- Greate for licensing which does not support multi-tenant or cloud deployments.
		- Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly).
		- Can be purchased as a Reservation for upto 70% off on On-Demand price.

	EC2 Exam Tips
	==================================
	- Termination protection is Turned Off by default, must turned it on if you want to protect your EC2 instance from actidental termination.
	- EC2 Storage Type Root can be encrypted now, but earlier it was not possible. You can also use a third party tool (such as bit locker etc)
	  to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMI's in the AWS console or using the API.
	- EC2 Storage Type Root is by default set true for "Delete on Instance Termination"
	- EC2 Storage Type EBS has more volumes types available then Root. 
	- EC2 Storage Type EBS is by default set false for "Delete on Instance Termination". That means after instance termination EBS volume 
	  can be attached with other EC2 Instance.
	- Additional volumes can be encrypted.
	
	===================================
	Security Groups
	===================================
	- All Inbound traffic is blocked by default.
	- All Outbound traffic is allowed.
	- Security Groups are stateful. If enable some IPs & Ports for Inbound traffic, outbound traffic will be enabled automatically.
	- You can attach one Security Group to many EC2 instances.
	- You can attach more than one Security Groups to your single EC2 instance.
	- Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.
	- You cannot blocked specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use NACL (Network Access Control Lists).
	- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
	
	===================================
	EBS (Elastic Block Store)
	===================================
	- What is EBS?
		- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS cloud.
		  Each EBS volume is automatically replicated with its Availibility Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high 
		  availibility and durability. These are general purpose virtual hard disk drives.
	
	===================================
	EBS Volumes
	===================================
	- 5 Different Types of EBS Storages:
		- General Purpose (SSD): For general purpose. Its Solid-State Drive (SSD)
		- Provisioned IOPS (SSD): For fast input/output per secnond. Its Solid-State Drive (SSD)
		- Throughput Optimized Hard Disk Drive: Physical hard disk drives (HDD); its now SSD its magnetic and optimized for throughput.
		- Cold Hard Disk Drive: Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads.
		- Magnetic: Previous generation HDD. For less frequently accessed workloads.
		
	- API Names of EBS Volume Types: REMEMBER API NAMES FOR EXAM
		- General Purpose (SSD) = gp2
		- Provisioned IOPS (SSD) = io1
		- Throughput Optimized (HDD) = st1
		- Cold Hard Disk Drive (HDD) = sc1
		- Magnetic (HDD) = standard

	===================================
	Volumes & Snapshots
	===================================
	- You can go to Volumes section of EC2 service to see and made changes on EBS volumes
	- Your EBS Volume will be on same Availibility Zone (AZ) as your EC2 instance to reduce latency.
	- 
	- You can change EBS volume size (increase/decrease Hard disk size) or storage type at runtime when EBS volume in use. 
	  It may impact you EC2 performance and may take time to propagate changes. 
	- You can changes EBS Volume Type for EC2 Root Volume at runtime. 
	  It may impact you EC2 performance and may take time to propagate changes.
	- When you terminate EC2 instance, Root volume attached to instance will also be terminated. 
	  Where as all other additional EBS volumes attached to instance will still be persisted.
	- You can migrate EBS volume Availibility Zone (AZ) by using snapshots.
	- Snapshot are stored in S3. Snapshot is a image of EBS volumes. You can create Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using snapshot. 
	  Later on you can launch new EC2 instance by using this AMI.
	- Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes.
	- Snapshots are incremental - This means that only blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3.
	- If this is your first snapshot, it may take some time to create.
	- To create a snapshot of EBS volumes that serve as Root devices. You should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
	- However you can take a snapshot while instance is running.
	- You can create AMI from Snapshot.
	
	- EXAM QUESTIONS: You have your EC2 instance and EBS volume in us-east-1b AZ and you want to migrate it to us-east-1c AZ. How can you do that?
		- Goto EC2 Service, Volumes Section.
		- Select EBS volume you want to change AZ.
		- Goto Actions and select Create Snapshot and give it name and create a snapshot out of it.
		- Goto Snapshots section to see newly created snapshot.
		- Now goto Actions under Snapshots section and select Create Image. You can use this image (AMI) to deploy on another AZs.
		- Create image (AMI) by giving it a name and select Vitrualization Type as Hardware-assisted virtualization . 
		  Vitrualization Type Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) will give you more options of EC2 instances type to select than a Paravirtual (PV). 
		- Now you can see your image (AMI) under AMIs section of EC2 service.
		- You can now configure & launch a new EC2 instance from AMIs section by selecting an Image.
		- While EC2 instance launch configuration you can select entirly different Subnet of AZ to launch EC2 instance in another AZ.
		- This is way you can migrate you EC2 and EBS volume from one AZ to another AZ.
		
		- You can move a copy of your AMI from one Region to another region.
			- Goto AMIs section of EC2 service.
			- Goto Actions and select Copy AMI.
			- Now you can select Destination Region. You can also encrypt snapshot of image. 
			- After creating a copy of your AMI you can goto another Region and Launch a EC2 instance using newly copied AMI.
	
	===================================
	AMI Types (EBS vs Instance Store)
	===================================
	- INSTANCE STORE: Some Amazon EC2 instance types come with a form of directly attached, 
		block-device storage known as the instance store. The instance store is ideal for temporary storage, because the data stored 
		in instance store volumes is not persistent through instance stops, terminations, or hardware failures.	 
	
	- EBS: For data you want to retain longer, or if you want to encrypt the data, use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. 
		EBS volumes preserve their data through instance stops and terminations, can be easily backed up with EBS snapshots, can be removed from
		one instance and reattached to another, and support full-volume encryption.
		
	- Difference between EBS vs Instance Store Volumes
		- EBS volume is network attached drive which results in slow performance but data is persistent meaning even if you reboot 
		  the instance data will be there. Instance Store is physically attached device which gives better performance but data 
		  will be lost once instance stops, terminations, or hardware failures.

	- You can select your AMI based on:
		- Region (see Regions and Availibility Zone)
		- Operation System
		- Architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
		- Launch Permission
		- Storage for the Root Device (Root Device Volume)
			- Instance Store (EPHEMERAL STORAGE)
			- EBS Backed Volumes
			
	- EBS vs Instance Store Volumes Launch
		- All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by Instance Stored.
		- FOR EBS Volumes: The root device for a instance lauched from the AMI, is an EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot.
		- FOR INSTANCE STORE VOLUMES: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI, is an instance store volume created 
		  from template stored in Amazon S3.
		  
	- Exam Tips
		- Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage.
		- Instance Store Volume backed instances cannot be stopped. There is no option to STOP. If underlying host fails, you will lose your data.
		- EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.
		- You can reboot both, you will not lose your data.
		- By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination. However with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.
	
	===================================
	ENI vs EN (ENA & VF) vs EFA
	===================================
	- ENI: Elastic Network Interface - essentially a virtual network card.
	- EN:  Enhanced Networking (EN). Uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high performance networking 
		   capability on supported instance types.
	- EFA: Elastic Fabric Adapter is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performace Computing (HPC)
		   and Machine learning applications.
		   
	- Elastic Network Interface
		- An ENI is simple a virtual network card for your EC2 instances. It allows:
			- A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.
			- One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.
			- One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address.
			- One public IPv4 address.
			- One or more IPv6 addresses.
			- One of more Security Groups.
			- A MAC address.
			- A source/destination check flag.
			- A description
		- Scenarios for ENI:
			- Create a management network.
			- Use network and security appliances in your VPC.
			- Create dual-homed instances with workloads/roles on distinct subnets.
			- Create a low budget, high-availibility solution.
	
	- Enhanced Networking 
		- It uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types.
		  SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provide higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to
		  traditional virtualized network interfaces.
		- Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packets per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance 
		  latencies. There is no additional charges for using Enhanced Networking.
		- Use where you want good network performance.
		
		- Enhanced Networking depending on your instance type. It can be enabled using:
			- ENA - Elastic Network Adapter (ENA), which supports network speeds of upto 100 Gbps for supported instance types.
			- VF - Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface, which supports network speeds of upto 10 Gbps for supported instance types. 
				  this is typically used on older instances.
		- In any scenario question, you probably want to choose ENA over VF if given the option.
		
	- Elastic Fabric Adapter
		- An EFA is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performace Computing (HPC) and 
		  machine learning applications.
		- EFA provides lower and more consistent latency and high throughput than the TCP transport traditionally used in cloud-based HPC system.
		- EFA can use OS-bypass. OS-bypass enable HPC and machine learning applications to bypass the operating system kernel and to communicate 
		  directly with the EFA device. It makes it a lot faster with a lot lower latency. Not supported with Windows currently, only Linux.
		   
	- Exam Tips
		- In the exam you will be given different scenarios and you will be asked to choose whether you should use an ENI, EN or EFA.
			- Elastic Network Interface for basic networking. Perhaps you need a separate management network to your production network 
			  or a seperate logging network and you need to do this a low cost. In this scenario use multiple ENIs for each network.
			- Enhanced Networking for when you need speeds between 10 Gbps to 100 Gbps. Anywhere you need reliable, high throughput.
			- Elastic Fabric Adapter for when you need to accelerate High Performace Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications or 
			  if you see scenario question mentioned HPC or ML and asking for what netwrok adapter you want, choose EFA.
			  
	============================================
	Encrypted Root Device Volumes & Snapshots 
	============================================
	- You can choose encryption option for Root Device Volume while attaching it to EC2 instance at the time of instance launch. Earlier there was no option
	  available to encrypt Root Device Volume at time of provisioning of EC2 instance.
	- There is another and old method of Root Device Volume encryption. Steps are:
		- Create a snapshot of Root Device Volume of EC2 instance.
		- Create a encrypted snapshot while creating copy of snapshot. You can enable encryption at time of creating a copy of snapshot.
		- Now create a new image (AMI) from encrypted snapshot.
		- After that you can provision a new EC2 instance using encrypted Root Device Volume image (AMI).
	- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
	- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically.
	- You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted.
	- These unencrypted snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public.
	- You can now encrypt root device volume upon creation of the EC2 instance.
