	EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
======================================

	=========================
	What is EC2?
	=========================
	- Amazon EC2 is web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and
	  boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up & down, as your computing requirement changes.
	
	=========================
	EC2 Pricing Models
	=========================
	- On Demand
		- Allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
		- Users that want to low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
		- Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
		- Applications being developed or tested on EC2 for first time.
	- Reserved
		- Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charges for a instance. 
		  Contract Terms are 1 year or 3 years Terms.
		- Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
		- Applications that required reserved capacity.
		- Users able to make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further.
		- Reserved Pricing Types
			- Standard Reserved Instances
				- These offer upto 75% off on demand instances. The more you pay up-front and the longer the contract, the greater the discount.
			- Convertible Reserved Instances
				- These offer upto 54% off on demand capability to change the attributes of the Reserved Instances as long as the exchanges 
				  results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value.
			- Scheduled Reserved Instances
				- These are available to launch within the time windows you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation
				  to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month.
	- Spot
		- Enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings.
		- Applications that have flexible start & end times.
		- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
		- Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.
		- If the Spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage.
		  However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.
	- Dedicated Hosts
		- Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your
		  existing server-bound software licenses. If you have strict licensing condition for example Oracle etc. 
		- Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
		- Greate for licensing which does not support multi-tenant or cloud deployments.
		- Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly).
		- Can be purchased as a Reservation for upto 70% off on On-Demand price.

	EC2 Instances Types - Mnemonic
	================================
	- F	- For FPGA
	- I - For IOPS
	- G - Graphics
	- H - High Disk Throughput 
	- T - Cheap general purpose (Think T2 Micro)
	- D - For Density
	- R - For RAM
	- M - Main choice for your general purpose apps
	- C - For Compute
	- P - Graphics (Thic Pics)
	- X - Extreme Memory
	- X - Extreme Memory & CPU
	- A - Arm-based workloads
	- U - Bare Metal

	EC2 Exam Tips
	==================================
	- Termination protection is Turned Off by default, must turned it on if you want to protect your EC2 instance from actidental termination.
	- EC2 Storage Type Root can be encrypted now, but earlier it was not possible. You can also use a third party tool (such as bit locker etc)
	  to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMI's in the AWS console or using the API.
	- EC2 Storage Type Root is by default set true for "Delete on Instance Termination"
	- EC2 Storage Type EBS has more volumes types available then Root. 
	- EC2 Storage Type EBS is by default set false for "Delete on Instance Termination". That means after instance termination EBS volume 
	  can be attached with other EC2 Instance.
	- Additional volumes can be encrypted.
	
	===================================
	Security Groups
	===================================
	- All Inbound traffic is blocked by default.
	- All Outbound traffic is allowed.
	- Security Groups are stateful. If enable some IPs & Ports for Inbound traffic, outbound traffic will be enabled automatically.
	- You can attach one Security Group to many EC2 instances.
	- You can attach more than one Security Groups to your single EC2 instance.
	- Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.
	- You cannot blocked specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use NACL (Network Access Control Lists).
	- You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
	
	===================================
	EBS (Elastic Block Store)
	===================================
	- What is EBS?
		- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS cloude.
		  Each EBS volume is automatically replicated with its Availibility Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high 
		  availibility and durability. These are general purpose virtual hard disk drives.
	
	===================================
	EBS Volumes
	===================================
	- 5 Different Types of EBS Storages:
		- General Purpose (SSD): For general purpose. Its Solid-State Drive (SSD)
		- Provisioned IOPS (SSD): For fast input/output per secnond. Its Solid-State Drive (SSD)
		- Throughput Optimized Hard Disk Drive: Physical hard disk drives (HDD); its now SSD its magnetic and optimized for throughput.
		- Cold Hard Disk Drive: Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads.
		- Magnetic: Previous generation HDD. For less frequently accessed workloads.
		
	- API Names of EBS Volume Types: REMEMBER API NAMES FOR EXAM
		- General Purpose (SSD) = gp2
		- Provisioned IOPS (SSD) = io1
		- Throughput Optimized (HDD) = st1
		- Cold Hard Disk Drive (HDD) = sc1
		- Magnetic (HDD) = standard
