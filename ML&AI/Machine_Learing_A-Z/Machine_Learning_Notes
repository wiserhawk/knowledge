====================================================
Data Processing in Python
====================================================
- Features
- Dependent Varibale

- Feature Scaling : Scaling feature values in meaningful range, which make data model easy and much effecient for ML.
- Feature Scaling Types
	- Standardisation: generate values between -3 to +3, Recommended for almost every case.
	- Normalisaton: generate values between -1 to +1

====================================================
Regression
====================================================

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. 
If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. 
Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random Forests Regression.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Regression models:

1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
5. Decision Tree Classification
6. Random Forest Classification

	- Simple Linear Regression
		- Y = C0 + C1 * X
		- Y is Dependent Varibale (DV)
		- X is Independent Varibale (IV)
		- C1 is Coefficient 
		- C0 is Constant
	
	- Multiple Linear Regression
		- Y = B0 + B1*X1 + B2*X2 + ... + Bn*Xn
		- Y is Dependent Varibale (DV)
		- X is Independent Varibale (IV)
		- B1...Bn is Coefficient 
		- B0 is Constant
		
		- A Caveat
			Assumptions of a Linear Regression; Before going with Linear Regression make sure below assumptions are true:
			- Linearity
			- Homoscedasticity
			- Multivariate normality
			- Independence of errors
			- Lack of multicollinearity

		- Dummy Variable Trap
		
		- 5 methods of building models:
			- All in 
			- Backward Elimination
			- Forward Selection
			- Bidirectional Elimination
			- Score Comparison
