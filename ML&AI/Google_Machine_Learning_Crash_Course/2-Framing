	- What is (Supervised) Machine Learning?
		- ML system learning create models
			- how to combine inputs
				- to produce usefull prrdictions
					- on never-before-seen data
					
	- Terminology: Labels and Features
		- LABEL: Label is the variable we are predicting
			- Typically represented by the varibale y
			- For example: A model which predict a mail is spam or not-spam, here "SPAM" or "NOT-SPAM" are labels.
		
		- FEATURES: Features are input variables describing our data
			- Typically represented by the variables {X1, X2, X3,......, Xn}
			- For example: Attributes which help model to predict result, i.e. Words in mails, sender email address, header information etc.

	- Terminology: Examples and Models
		- EXAMPLE is a particlar instance of data, x
		
		- LABELED EXAMPLE has {feature, lable}: (x, y)
			- Used to train the model
		
		- UNLABELED EXAMPLE has {feature, ?}: (x, ?)
			- Used for making predictions on new data
		
		- MODEL maps examples to predicted labels: y
			- Defined by internal parameters, which are learned
			
	- Models (Traning & Inference)
		- A model defines the relationship between features and label. For example, a spam detection model might associate certain features strongly with "spam". 
		  Let's highlight two phases of a model's life:

			- TRAINING means creating or learning the model. That is, you show the model labeled examples and enable the model to gradually learn the relationships 
			  between features and label.
			
			- INFERENCE means applying the trained model to unlabeled examples. That is, you use the trained model to make useful predictions (y'). 
			  For example, during inference, you can predict medianHouseValue for new unlabeled examples.		
			
	- Regression vs. Classification
		- A REGRESSION model predicts continuous values. For example, regression models make predictions that answer questions like the following:
			- What is the value of a house in California?
			- What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?

		- A CLASSIFICATION model predicts discrete values. For example, classification models make predictions that answer questions like the following:
			- Is a given email message spam or not spam?
			- Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?
