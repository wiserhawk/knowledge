	Descending into ML: Training and Loss
	========================================
	- Training
		- Training a model simply means learning (determining) good values for all the weights and the bias from labeled examples. 
		  In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempting to find a model
		  that minimizes loss; this process is called empirical risk minimization.

	- Loss
		- Loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. That is, loss is a number indicating how bad the model's prediction was on a single example. 
		  If the model's prediction is perfect, the loss is zero; otherwise, the loss is greater. The goal of training a model is to find a set 
		  of weights and biases that have low loss, on average, across all examples given for training.
