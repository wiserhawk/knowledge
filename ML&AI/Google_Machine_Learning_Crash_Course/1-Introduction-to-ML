	- Benefits of using ML
		- Reduce Time for Programming: This give you tool to reduce time to do programming.
		  For example, creating English to hindi language translator program.
		
		- Customize and Scale Products: ML proram can be customize accoding to need and can be scaled accordingly. 
		  For example, you use same ML trained models to create another langular translator by just giving them lots of
		  of data for model training. That way you can scale you translator easly with other languages. 
		  
		- Complete seemingly "Unprogrammable" Tasks: Some of the problem that engineer have no idea how to program them
		  can be solve using ML. For example, its had to recognize humen faces using programming. But these kind of task
		  ML algorithms can do very efficiently. We have to just show algorithm lots of example of humen faces to trained it.
		  
		- Philosophical Reasion: ML changes the way you think about problem. Software engineer are trained to think logically 
		  and mathematically, we use assertion to prove properties get program correct. But in ML focus shit from mathematically
		  science to natural science. We make observation about uncertain world, running experements and using statistics,
		  not logic to prove the results of experements.
