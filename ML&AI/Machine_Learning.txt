Machine Learning Algorithms
	- Supervised Learning: Tell computer to how to work 
	- Unsupervised Learning: Computer learn for its own experience.
	- Others: Reinforcement Learning, Recommender System.
	
Supervised Learning
	- This kind of algorithms to which we provide large data sets and algorithms try to produce more accurate results by learing from datasets. 
	For example, predicting house pices based on large number of dataset of sold houses.
	
	- Regression Problem: Predicting continuous valued outputs (prices). 
		This kind of problems works of identical types of dataset and try to predict continuous value outputs from that
		For example, predicting house pices based on large number of dataset of sold houses.
	- Classification Problem:  Discrete valued output ( 0 or 1). 
		This kind problems works on different types of dataset and try to categories data into different categories.
		For example, pridecting Breast Cancer is Malignant (serious) or Benign (not harmful).
